            I lose money on this site monthly. I pay $75/month ($40 server, $35 api access). This action you did
            takes a lot of resources on this server. Quite recently it has been hammered costing me more money.

            You are welcome to donate to help offset these costs. Leave me your gamertag, and you'll earn the <strong>Leaf badge</strong>

            <br />
            So in short - I have to rate limit it heavily to 10 exports per hour per user.
